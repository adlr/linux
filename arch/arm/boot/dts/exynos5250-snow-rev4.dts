	 * Define with revisions this tree is compatible with.
	 * - Any real rev 0-3 boards in the field will match "google,snow",
	 *   since older U-Boots don't look for a revision specific device tree.
	 * - Any real rev 4 boards in the field will match "google,snow-rev4"
	 *   first.  If that's not present they will pick the first
	 *   "google,snow" device tree that they find (ignoring the kernel
	 *   ordering).
	 * - We put an ugly "google,snow-any" here to provide the kernel a way
	 *   to test for any snow device.
	 * - Note that revision here is logical revision (monotonically
	 *   increasing) which means it's not exactly what's read from board
	 *   strappings.
