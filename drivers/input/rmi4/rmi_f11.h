/** A note about RMI4 F11 register structure.
 *
 *  There may be one or more individual 2D touch surfaces associated with an
 * instance for F11.  For example, a handheld device might have a touchscreen
 * display on the front, and a touchpad on the back.  F11 represents these touch
 * surfaces as individual sensors, up to 7 on a given RMI4 device.
 *
 * The properties for
 * a given sensor are described by its query registers.  The number of query
 * registers and the layout of their contents are described by the F11 device
 * queries as well as the per-sensor query information.  The query registers
 * for sensor[n+1] immediately follow those for sensor[n], so the start address
 * of the sensor[n+1] queries can only be computed if you know the size of the
 * sensor[n] queries.  Because each of the sensors may have different
 * properties, the size of the query registers for each sensor must be
 * calculated on a sensor by sensor basis.
 *
 * Similarly, each sensor has control registers that govern its behavior.  The
 * size and layout of the control registers for a given sensor can be determined
 * by parsing that sensors query registers.  The control registers for
 * sensor[n+1] immediately follow those for sensor[n], so you can only know
 * the start address for the sensor[n+1] controls if you know the size (and
 * location) of the sensor[n] controls.
 *
 * And in a likewise fashion, each sensor has data registers where it reports
 * its touch data and other interesting stuff.  The size and layout of a
 * sensors data registers must be determined by parsing its query registers.
 * The data registers for sensor[n+1] immediately follow those for sensor[n],
 * so you can only know the start address for the sensor[n+1] controls if you
 * know the size (and location) of the sensor[n] controls.
 *
 * The short story is that we need to read and parse a lot of query
 * registers in order to determine the attributes of a sensor[0].  Then
 * we need to use that data to compute the size of the control and data
 * registers for sensor[0].  Once we have that figured out, we can then do
 * the same thing for each subsequent sensor.
 *
 * The end result is that we have a number of structs that aren't used to
 * directly generate the input events, but their size, location and contents
 * are critical to determining where the data we are interested in lives.
 *
 * At this time, the driver does not yet comprehend all possible F11
 * configuration options, but it should be sufficient to cover 99% of RMI4 F11
 * devices currently in the field.
